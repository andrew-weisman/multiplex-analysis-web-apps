# Neighborhood Profiles Imaging App 
## NCATS-NCI-DMAP

## Welcome
Welcome to the Neighborhood Profiles Imaging App presented by NCATS-NCI-DMAP. This is your one stop resource for data exploration, algorithm tuning, and figure generation. The below is a guide to using this app with step-by-step 

## Neighborhoood Profiles workflow
Based on the conversations with our working groups, the following is the intended workflow for using this application.  
1. Importing Data: The first step is to load the data 


### Phenotyping
The first page to start your analysis pipeline is the phenotyping page. This is where you will load your data, view your different feature conditions, and select your phenotyping. 

### Neighborhood Profiles (UMAP)
Once data is loaded and phenotyped appropriately, the first steps in analysis can commence. The first step is to calculate the 

### Clustering Differences
After completing the UMAP decomposition and clustering analysis, the user may now take a look at the down-stream figures generated as a result of these analyses. While there are not many levers and knobs to change the data implicitly here, the user can generate different figures.
1. Before starting to view these Clustering Differences, you must complete at least the UMAP processing seen on the previous page. To experience the full offering of the Clustering Differences page, you must also complete the Clustering step on the previous page. There are warnings on the page to help you remember what needs to be completed in order to see each figure.
2. The Figures that are available for viewing:  
    1. Full 2D UMAP
    2. 2D UMAP filtered by lineage and by Output Variables
    3.
