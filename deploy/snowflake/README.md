# Deploying on Snowflake

1. Add setup scripts 01-04 in `deploy/snowflake`.
1. Add orchestration functionality (`snowflake_orchestrator.py`) to mimic that in `docker_orchestrator/main.py`.
1. Add "snowflake" branches in `platform_abstraction.py`.
1. Step through setup scripts 01-04 in `deploy/snowflake`.

Note that the only existing code that is modified is `platform_abstraction.py`.
